The project you're working on involves analyzing the "Social Media Usage and Emotional Well-Being" dataset. The goal is to explore how different aspects of social media usage—such as daily time spent, posts per day, likes received, and other engagement metrics—affect emotional well-being, using various machine learning models for predictive analysis
Objective:
The main goal is to understand the correlation between social media usage patterns and emotional well-being. Specifically:

Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset to remove any missing or inconsistent data.
Feature Engineering: Create meaningful new features (e.g., engagement per post or usage categories) and transform data to ensure it is ready for modeling.
Modeling: Implement various machine learning models such as:
Linear Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
XGBoost These models will predict emotional well-being based on the features related to social media usage.
Evaluation: Compare models based on performance metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and other relevant statistics.
Visualization: Visualize the relationships between various social media usage behaviors and emotional well-being using plots, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps.
